## The ECB, the Digital Euro and the Future of e-Money

When preparing my recent presentation on the ECB, I decided to pay special attention to the development of the digital euro. While reading about the ongoing discussions on the nature and purpose of the digital euro, it became clear that many people still perceive it as a crypto-like experiment.

However, the ECB clearly frames it as:

- public money in digital form  
- fully backed by central bank liability  
- privacy-focused, non-speculative  
- delivered through supervised intermediaries  

This makes it the baseline model for how digital payments should work in Europe, both technically and legally.

## Why e-money rules matter

Mapping EU rules on e-money, transactions, and licensing is not a simple task, especially when it comes to developing digital platforms. Most developers still misunderstand what “money” is under EU law.

Under EU rules:

- e-money = a monetary claim on the issuer  
- e-money is issued only by authorised institutions under EU law  
- platforms cannot touch user funds without regulatory approval  

Platforms that hold customer funds or issue e-money must be licensed under EU payments and e-money rules.

## Why the digital euro matters for developers

This is why the digital euro matters.

It can shift most of the licensing burden to regulated intermediaries, so developers can integrate digital euro payments without first becoming e-money issuers.

## Regulatory impact and compliance

So, how is the digital euro going to reshape the current regulation?

The biggest impact is not only on consumers but also on compliance expectations for private payment providers. The digital euro will push the EU toward:

- stricter privacy-by-design standards  
- harmonized authentication and onboarding  
- stronger cybersecurity obligations  
- clearer rules for intermediaries  
- a more clearly defined regulatory role for digital euro wallet providers  

It becomes the regulatory anchor for the future payment framework.

E-money firms will not compete with the digital euro in functionality; they will compete in compliance quality.

## Looking ahead

In the future, we can expect AI systems, devices, and platforms to start making automated micro-payments to each other. In that environment, Europe will need a trusted, neutral settlement layer.

## Conclusion

The digital euro should not be viewed as a new currency.  
It is a regulatory project presented through a new payment form, and it will shape:

- how private e-money is supervised  
- how developers design digital payment systems  
- how the EU ensures trust in automated financial environments  

The choices made now will define the room that private innovators, payment firms, and developers have in the next generation of European finance.
