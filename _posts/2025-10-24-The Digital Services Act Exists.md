title: "Digital Services Act: What small platforms need to know"

If you run a small platform or website in the EU, you’ve probably heard of the Digital Services Act (DSA) — or maybe not, because it seems like nobody is talking about it.

The truth? It’s real, in force, and technically applies to almost everyone online, even if enforcement still feels asleep.

## What the DSA Actually Is

The DSA is an EU-wide regulation that sets new rules for online intermediaries, including websites, apps, marketplaces, platforms—anything that hosts or shares user content.

It’s meant to make digital life safer and more transparent, forcing platforms to explain how they moderate content, handle illegal posts, and interact with users.

Unlike older directives, the DSA is directly applicable, meaning no national law is needed. It already has legal effect in all EU countries.

## “But nobody is complying…”

You’re not wrong. Outside the biggest tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok, most small and mid-sized platforms haven’t done much yet.

Partly because national enforcement bodies are still getting organized and partly because small business owners think it only applies to “Big Tech.” That’s a myth.

## Why small platforms still fall under it

If your website connects users, stores content, or lets people interact, you’re very likely within DSA scope. That includes:

- artist–reviewer platforms
- niche marketplaces
- online communities
- any app hosting user profiles, listings, or comments

You don’t need millions of users or financial services — if users upload and share, the DSA sees you.

## What small operators actually need to do

No need for panic or audits. The core DSA duties for smaller sites are manageable:

- Have clear Terms of Service explaining moderation and removal rules
- Offer a contact point for authorities and users
- Provide a simple way to report illegal content
- Publish a basic transparency report once a year if you moderate content

That’s it — and doing this now saves stress later!

## The DSA isn’t sleeping forever

Enforcement is slow, but not dead. The European Commission has already fined and investigated large platforms.

Once national regulators fully staff up, they’ll look downstream — and that means to medium and smaller platforms.

So, even if “nobody else” seems to care right now, compliance will soon shift from optional to expected.

## Bottom line

The Digital Services Act is already alive. It just hasn’t started shouting yet. If your platform connects people, you’re part of it — and small steps now will save you big headaches later.
